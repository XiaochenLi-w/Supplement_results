# Supplement for HG-LDP manuscript

## Appendix
A file named Appendix.pdf is provided, which includes proofs of theorems in the manuscript and results of supplementary experiments.

## Code
The implementation has been open-sourced and integrated as a sub-module in a project. The code is now available for public request. We note that it is challenging to provide an anonymous GitHub repository for the submission because the (Java) package name would reveal authors' affiliations, and renaming leads to significant updates since the implementation invokes other sub-modules in the same project.
